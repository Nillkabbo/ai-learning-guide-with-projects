# Chapter 30 Learning Guide: Building Your AI Product

## Overview

This final chapter covers moving from AI systems to AI products. You'll learn problem-first thinking, the Lean AI Canvas, MVP development, data flywheels, ethical considerations, and launching successful AI products.

## Educator Perspective

### Teaching Strategy

**Key Concepts to Emphasize:**
1. Problem-first, not technology-first
2. Lean AI Canvas for planning
3. MVP development (Wizard of Oz)
4. Data flywheel for competitive advantage
5. Ethics and responsibility

**Common Student Struggles:**
