# Chapter 10 Project: Advanced Problem Solver

## Project Overview

Build a problem-solving system that implements all advanced prompting strategies: self-consistency, tree-of-thought, ReAct, multi-agent debate, and reflexion. Compare approaches and choose the best strategy for different problem types.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement all advanced strategies
- Compare strategy effectiveness
- Choose appropriate strategy per problem
- Build complete problem-solving system

## Project Type

**Cumulative** - Builds on Chapter 9, demonstrates advanced prompting mastery.

## Prerequisites
