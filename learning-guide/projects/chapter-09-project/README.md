# Chapter 9 Project: Smart IoT Diagnostic System

## Project Overview

Build an intelligent IoT diagnostic system using all fundamental prompt engineering patterns. The system uses zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, and role-based prompting to diagnose device issues accurately.

## Learning Objectives

- Apply all prompt engineering patterns
- Create effective few-shot examples
- Implement chain-of-thought reasoning
- Use role-based expert personas
- A/B test prompt variations
- Build complete diagnostic system

## Project Type

**Cumulative** - Builds on previous chapters, demonstrates prompt engineering mastery.

## Prerequisites
