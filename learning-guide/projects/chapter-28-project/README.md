# Chapter 28 Project: Automated IoT Incident Response Workflow

## Project Overview

Build a complete automated IoT incident response workflow using DAGs, orchestration, error recovery, and human-in-the-loop patterns. Demonstrates complex AI workflow patterns for production systems.

## Learning Objectives

- Design workflows with DAGs
- Build workflow orchestrator
- Implement error recovery
- Integrate human-in-the-loop
- Build complete automated workflow

## Project Type

**Cumulative** - Builds on all previous chapters, demonstrates workflow orchestration.

## Prerequisites

- Completed Chapter 28
- Understanding of DAGs
- Knowledge of async programming
- Basic workflow concepts

## Project Requirements

### Core Features
