# Chapter 19 Project: IoT Analytics Platform

## Project Overview

Build a complete IoT analytics platform using architectural patterns: event-driven design, polyglot persistence, configuration management, and microservices architecture. Demonstrates production-grade architecture.

## Learning Objectives

- Design system architecture
- Implement event-driven patterns
- Use polyglot persistence
- Manage configuration
- Build complete platform

## Project Type

**Cumulative** - Builds on all previous chapters, demonstrates complete architecture.

## Prerequisites

- Completed Chapter 19
- Understanding of system design
- Knowledge of databases
- Understanding of messaging
