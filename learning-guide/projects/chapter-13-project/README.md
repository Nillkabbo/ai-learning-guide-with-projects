# Chapter 13 Project: Autonomous IoT Monitoring Agent

## Project Overview

Build a complete autonomous IoT monitoring agent with perception, memory, reasoning, and action components. The agent monitors devices, maintains state, makes decisions, and takes actions autonomously.

## Learning Objectives

- Build agent components
- Implement agent loop
- Create autonomous behavior
- Handle state and memory
- Build complete agent system

## Project Type

**Cumulative** - Builds on all previous chapters, demonstrates complete agent architecture.

## Prerequisites

- Completed Chapter 13
- Understanding of agent concepts
- Can build Python classes
- Basic async knowledge helpful

## Project Requirements
