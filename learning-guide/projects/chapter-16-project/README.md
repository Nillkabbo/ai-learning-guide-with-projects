# Chapter 16 Project: Multi-Agent IoT Management System

## Project Overview

Build a multi-agent system with specialized agents for monitoring, diagnostics, maintenance, and reporting. Implements coordination patterns, communication protocols, and consensus mechanisms for complex IoT management.

## Learning Objectives

- Design multi-agent architecture
- Implement coordination patterns
- Build communication protocols
- Create consensus mechanisms
- Build complete multi-agent system

## Project Type

**Cumulative** - Builds on Chapters 13-15, demonstrates multi-agent coordination.

## Prerequisites

- Completed Chapter 16
- Understanding of single agents
- Basic async/concurrency knowledge

## Project Requirements

### Core Features

1. **Specialized Agents**
   - Monitoring agent

   - Maintenance agent
   - Reporting agent

2. **Coordination**
   - Centralized coordinator
   - Task distribution
   - Result aggregation
   - Conflict resolution

3. **Communication**
   - Message passing
   - Shared state
   - Event system
   - Protocols

4. **Consensus**
   - Voting mechanisms
   - Decision making
   - Conflict resolution
   - Agreement protocols

## Project Milestones

1. Agent specialization (1.5 hours)
2. Coordination (1.5 hours)
3. Communication (1.5 hours)
