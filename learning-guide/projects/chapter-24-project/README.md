# Chapter 24 Project: IoT Command Validation Test Suite

## Project Overview

Build a complete testing suite for an IoT command validation system using unit tests with mocks, integration tests, AI regression tests, and load testing. Demonstrates all testing patterns for AI systems.

## Learning Objectives

- Write unit tests with mocks
- Create integration tests
- Build AI regression tests
- Perform load testing
- Create complete test suite

## Project Type

**Cumulative** - Builds on all previous chapters, demonstrates testing best practices.

## Prerequisites

- Completed Chapter 24
- Understanding of testing
- Knowledge of pytest
- Basic mocking skills

## Project Requirements

### Core Features

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Mock API calls
   - Test prompt construction
   - Test response handling
   - Fast, deterministic

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test full workflows
   - Real API calls (limited)
   - Test prompt chains
   - Validate end-to-end

3. **AI Regression Tests**
   - Golden dataset
   - AI judge
   - Quality scoring
   - Prevent degradation

4. **Load Testing**
   - Performance under load
   - Cost under load
   - Rate limit handling
   - Scalability testing

5. **Test Suite**
   - All tests integrated
   - CI/CD ready
   - Automated execution
   - Reporting

## Project Milestones

1. Unit tests (1.5 hours)
2. Integration tests (1.5 hours)
3. Regression tests (1.5 hours)
4. Load tests (1.5 hours)
5. Complete suite (2 hours)

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Unit tests pass
