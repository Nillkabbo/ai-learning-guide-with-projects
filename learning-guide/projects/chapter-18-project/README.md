# Chapter 18 Project: Real-Time IoT Anomaly Detection System

## Project Overview

Build a real-time IoT anomaly detection system using WebSockets, background workers, caching, and rate limiting. The system detects anomalies in real-time and alerts users immediately.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement WebSockets for real-time communication
- Use background workers for AI processing
- Design caching strategies
- Build rate limiters
- Create complete real-time system

## Project Type

**Cumulative** - Builds on Chapter 17, demonstrates real-time patterns.

## Prerequisites

- Completed Chapter 18
- Understanding of async/await
- Basic knowledge of Celery/Redis
- Understanding of WebSockets

## Project Requirements
