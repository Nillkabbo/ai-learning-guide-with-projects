# Chapter 20 Project: Globally-Scalable IoT Platform

## Project Overview

Build a globally-scalable IoT platform using horizontal scaling, queue-based architecture, microservices, and database optimization. Demonstrates all scaling patterns for production systems.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement horizontal scaling
- Build queue-based systems
- Scale microservices independently
- Optimize databases
- Build globally-scalable platform

## Project Type

**Cumulative** - Builds on Chapter 19, demonstrates scaling patterns.

## Prerequisites
