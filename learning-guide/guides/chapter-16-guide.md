## Educator Perspective

### Teaching Strategy

**Key Concepts to Emphasize:**
1. Multiple specialized agents
2. Coordination patterns
3. Communication protocols
4. Consensus mechanisms
5. System architectures

**Common Student Struggles:**
- **"Why multiple agents?"**: Show specialization benefits
- **"Coordination is complex"**: Start with simple patterns
- **"Communication overhead"**: Explain tradeoffs
- **"When to use multi-agent?"**: Explain use cases

**Teaching Sequence:**

2. Coordination patterns
3. Communication
4. Consensus
5. Complete system

**Pacing:**
- This chapter should take 4-5 hours
- Emphasize coordination
- Build multi-agent system
- Test coordination
