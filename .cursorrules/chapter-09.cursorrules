# Chapter 9: Fundamental Prompt Engineering - Cursor Rules

## Chapter Context

This chapter teaches fundamental prompt engineering - the art of crafting effective prompts. Students learn zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based prompting, and A/B testing. Foundation for all advanced prompting.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Five Elements of Effective Prompts
- **Task**: Clear action verb (Summarize, Translate, Classify)
- **Context**: Background information needed
- **Format**: Desired output structure (JSON, list, paragraph)
- **Examples**: Few-shot demonstrations
- **Role**: Expert persona to adopt

### 2. Zero-Shot Prompting
- No examples provided
- Relies on training knowledge
- Works for common tasks
- Simplest approach

### 3. Few-Shot Prompting
- Provide 2-7 examples
- Demonstrates desired pattern
- More reliable than zero-shot
- Cost: more tokens

### 4. Chain-of-Thought Prompting
- Show reasoning steps
- "Let's think step by step"
- Improves complex reasoning
- More tokens but better accuracy

### 5. Role-Based Prompting
- Assign expert persona
- Domain-specific knowledge
- Consistent behavior
- Professional tone

### 6. A/B Testing
- Test prompt variations
- Measure metrics (accuracy, cost, speed)
- Statistical significance
- Iterative improvement

## Important Code Patterns

### Zero-Shot
```python
prompt = "Classify this device status: {status}"
response = ai.call(prompt)
```

### Few-Shot
```python
prompt = """
Classify device statuses:

Input: "TEMP-001: 85°C, Battery: 15%"
Output: Critical

Input: "HUM-002: 45%, Battery: 80%"
Output: Healthy

Input: "{status}"
Output:
"""
```

### Chain-of-Thought
```python
prompt = """
Analyze this IoT issue step by step:

Problem: {problem}

Step 1: Identify symptoms
Step 2: Consider possible causes
Step 3: Evaluate likelihood
Step 4: Recommend solution
"""
```

### Role-Based
```python
system = "You are an expert IoT engineer with 15 years of experience..."
prompt = f"{system}\n\nAnalyze: {issue}"
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Vague prompts**: Always be specific
2. **Missing context**: Provide necessary background
3. **No format specification**: AI needs structure guidance
4. **Too many examples**: Diminishing returns after 5-7
5. **Wrong temperature**: Use 0.0-0.3 for structured, 0.7 for creative
6. **Not testing**: Always A/B test important prompts

## Integration Points

- **Chapters 5-8**: Apply to all APIs
- **Chapter 10**: Advanced strategies build on this
- **Chapter 11**: Structured output uses these patterns
- **Chapter 12**: Domain-specific extends role-based
