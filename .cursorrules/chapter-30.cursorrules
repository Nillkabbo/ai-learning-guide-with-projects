# Chapter 30: Building Your AI Product - Cursor Rules

## Chapter Context

This final chapter covers moving from AI systems to AI products. Students learn problem-first thinking, Lean AI Canvas, MVP development, data flywheels, ethics, and launching successful AI products. Synthesizes all learning into product thinking.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Problem-First Mindset
- **Technology-first is wrong**: "What can AI do?" → demos, not products
- **Problem-first is right**: "What problem can AI solve?" → products
- AI is the engine, not the car
- Users want solutions, not technology
- Value delivery over technical capability

### 2. Lean AI Canvas
- One-page product blueprint
- Forces critical questions:
  - Problem, customers, value proposition
  - Solution, AI core, data moat
  - Metrics, channels, costs, revenue
  - Unfair advantage
- Validates ideas before building
- Exposes weaknesses early

### 3. MVP Development
- Minimum Viable Product (smallest version that solves core problem)
- **Wizard of Oz MVP**: Human does "AI" work to test demand
- Fast validation (test before building)
- Generate training data (expert analyses become dataset)
- Cheap and quick

### 4. Data Flywheel
- Competitive advantage through data
- More users → more data → better product → more users
- Defensible moat (hard to replicate)
- Design from day one (capture interaction data)
- Privacy-protected (with consent)

### 5. Ethics and Responsibility
- Ethical review checklist
- Bias and fairness
- Privacy and consent
- Transparency
- Responsible AI practices
- Real-world impact

## Important Code Patterns

### Lean AI Canvas Structure
```
1. Problem (top 1-3 problems)
2. Customer Segments (target + early adopters)
3. Unique Value Proposition
4. Solution (top 3 features)
5. AI Core (specific AI skill)
6. Data Moat (how product improves)
7. Key Metrics (success measures)
8. Channels (paths to customers)
9. Cost Structure (fixed + variable)
10. Revenue Streams
11. Unfair Advantage
```

### Data Flywheel Design
```python
# Conceptual flywheel
def data_flywheel_cycle():
    # More users
    users = get_active_users()
    
    # More interaction data
    interactions = capture_interactions(users)
    
    # Better insights/model
    improved_model = train_on_new_data(interactions)
    
    # Improved product
    deploy_improved_model(improved_model)
    
    # Attracts more users (cycle repeats)
    return improved_model
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Technology-first thinking**: Build for problems, not tech
2. **No planning**: Canvas saves months of wrong building
3. **Over-building MVP**: Start simple, validate first
4. **No data strategy**: Miss competitive advantage
5. **Ignoring ethics**: Real consequences, legal issues

## Integration Points

- **All previous chapters**: Technical foundation for products
- **Chapter 19**: Architecture (product architecture)
- **Chapter 25**: Deployment (product deployment)

## Course Completion

This chapter synthesizes all learning into product thinking. Students should now be able to:
- Build AI systems (Chapters 1-28)
- Understand future trends (Chapter 29)
- Build AI products (Chapter 30)
